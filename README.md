# 🏠 House Rent Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **house rent prices** using machine learning regression techniques.  
The objective is to analyze rental property data, perform effective preprocessing, and build a reliable prediction model using Python and scikit-learn.

The project follows an end-to-end machine learning workflow including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature transformation
- Model training using regression algorithms
- Model evaluation using R² score and cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Saving the trained pipeline for future predictions

---

## 📊 Dataset Used
The dataset contains information related to rental properties, including both numerical and categorical features.

### Common features include:
- Location
- City
- Size or area of the house
- Number of bedrooms,bathrooms,balconies
- Furnishing status
- House details
- area rate (rent/area)

### Target Variable:
- **Rent** (log-transformed using `log1p` to improve model performance)

- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach
- Regression-based models
- Pipeline-based preprocessing
- Cross-validation for performance evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model persistence using `.pkl` file

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Cross-validation score

## Key changes
- Removed area_rate which was the source of data leakage and caused overfitting.
- Handled Outliers
- Added hyperparameter tuning to estract best parameters.
